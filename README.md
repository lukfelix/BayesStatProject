# FILESTRUCTURE

"analysis.py" contains the entire analysis, from simulation, to modelling, all the way to mcmc. It is the "mother file". 

The other files contain certain functions which are being used via the analysis.py file. Those are all the "children files" and do not perform anything on their own. They are simply placeholders for certain functions.
